                <p>
                Bigfoot a.k.a. Sasquatch, is a gigantic, hairy, bipedal, primate said to be 10-12 ft. tall. Rumors say its main living grounds
                are in Northwest America, although many people have said they have seen Bigfoot across the US & Canada, even on different continents. 
                Its 2nd name, Sasquatch derives from the Salish name “Sasquits.”

            <h2>When & Where Did the Tale Begin?</h2>
                <p>
                Bigfoot is super cool. People have been trying to look for him since the 1900s and tales about it date back all the way to
                Pre-Columbian America! Many Native-American tribes share folk-lore tales of a tall 10-foot hairy beast that prowls North America.
                Fast forwarding to the 1800s, Americans pushing west said that they had evidence to prove the existence of the folklore
                creature. Discovering huge footprints bigger than any man could leave behind. However, it wasn't until halfway through the next
                century that the race to find bigfoot found traction. In 1958, news media picked up a story about Ray Wallace, a road contractor 
                working in northern California who made plaster casts of giant footprints that he found near his worksite. Most of Bigfoot's sightings 
                were hearsay. This was the first time a physical model was made to show evidence of Bigfoot. As time went on, the compulsion to
                find Bigfoot ignited in the 1990's and 2000's.
