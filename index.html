            <h2>What or Who is Bigfoot?</h2>
            <p>
                Bigfoot a.k.a. Sasquatch, derived from the Salish name “Sasquits,” is a gigantic, hairy, bipedal, primate said to be 10-12 ft.
                tall. Rumors say that its habitat is in the American Northwest, although there are hundreds of reported cases of people seeing
                Bigfoot across the globe in different continents, including but not limited to France, Turkey, and even Antarctica. However, the
                vast majority of sightings have been located in the US & Canada. Today, Bigfoot stands as one of the largest faces of cryptozoology, 
                a pseudoscience that searches and studies unknown, legendary, or extinct animals whose existence is disputed or unsubstantiated,
                such as the Yeti, Loch Ness Monster, or the Chupacabra.

            <h2>When & Where Did the Tale Begin?</h2>
            <p>
                People have been trying to look for him since the 1900s and tales about him date back all the way to pre-Columbian America! Many
                Native-American tribes share folk-lore tales of a tall 10-foot hairy beast that prowls North America. Fast forwarding to the
                1800s, Americans pushing west said that they had evidence to prove the existence of the folk-lore creature, discovering huge 
                footprints bigger than any man could leave behind. However, it wasn't until half-way through the next century when the race to find 
                Bigfoot found traction. In 1958, news media picked up a story about Ray Wallace, a road contractor working in northern California 
                who made plaster casts of giant footprints that he found near his worksite. Although most Bigfoot sightings were hearsay, this was the first 
                time a physical model was made to show evidence of Bigfoot.
