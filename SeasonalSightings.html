            <p> We can see that the majority of bigfoot sightings occur during the Summer, followed by Fall, Spring, and Winter. Why might that be the case?</p>
            <p> Here are a few suggestions:<p>

        <section>
            <ul>
                <li>Berries ripen during the Summer</li>
                <li>Bigfoot may favor a warmer climate</li>
                <li>Black Bears</li>
                <li>Outside activities take place</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Bigfoot enthusiasts have suggested that berries are one of the food sources for Bigfoot. It is natural for Bigfoot to be spotted in the summer because berries often ripen and are ready for picking in June. Bigfoot enthusiasts have also commented on how Bigfoot prefers warm temperatures. If they were ever sighted during the winter, it was because Bigfoot was looking for a warm area. There were also suggestions that many of the reports were actually black bears mistaken for bigfoot. Interestingly, berries are a source of food for black bears, which are also the least active during the winter, since they would be hibernating, which corresponds to the graph's pattern. Most importantly, Summer and Fall are the most active seasons for humans, contributing to the such high percentage of sightings shown in the graph. </p>
