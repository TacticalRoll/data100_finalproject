            <p> We can see that most bigfoot reportings occur during the Summer, followed by Fall, Spring, and Winter. Does anyone wonder why Summer has such high percentages?</p>
            <p> Here are a few suggestions:<p>
            </p>
        </section>
        <div class="listitem">
            <ul>
                <li>Berries ripe during the Summer</li>
                <li>Favor for warmer climate</li>
                <li>Black Bears</li>
                <li>Outside activities take place</li>
            </ul>
         </div>
            <p>Bigfoot enthusiasts have suggested that berries are one of the food sources for Bigfoot. It is natural for Bigfoot to be spotted in the summer because berries often ripenÂ and are ready for picking in June. Bigfoot enthusiasts have also commented on how Bigfoot prefers warm temperatures. If they were ever sighted during the winter, it was because Bigfoot was looking for a warm area. There were also suggestions that many of the reports were actually black bears mistaken for bigfoot. Interestingly, berries are a source of food for black bears, which are also the least active during the winter, hibernating, which corresponds to the graph's pattern.Most importantly, Summer and Fall are the most active seasons for humans, contributing the such high percentages shown in the graph. </p>
