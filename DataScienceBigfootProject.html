                Bigfoot a.k.a. Sasquatch, is a giaganitc, hairy, bipedal, primate said to be 10-12 ft. tall. Rumors say its main living grounds
                are in NorthWest America, although many people have said they have seen Bigfoot acorss the US & Canada, even in different continents. 
                Its 2nd name, Sasquatch derives from the Salish name “Sasquits.”

            <h2>When & Where Did the Tale Begin?</h2>
                <p>
                Bigfoot is super cool. People have been trying to look for him since the 1900's and tales about him date back all the way to
                Pre-Columbian America! Many Native-American tribes share folk-lore tales of a tall 10-foot hairy beast that prowls North America.
                Fast forwarding into the 1800's, Americans pushing west said that they have evidence to prove the existance of the folk-lore
                creature. Discovering huge footprints bigger than any man could leave behind. However, it wasn't until half-way through the next
                cenutry when the race to find bigfoot found traction. In 1958, news media picked up a story about Ray Wallace, a road contractor 
                working in northern California made plaster casts of giant footprints that he found near his worksite. Most of Bigfoot sightings 
                were heresay. This was the first time a physical model was made to show edvidnce of Bigfoot. As time went on, the complusion to
                find Bigfoot ignited in the 1990's and 2000's.
