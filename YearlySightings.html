                Bigfoot sightings were rare and far in between early on. Likely, it wasn't until the rise of the internet and social media that word of Bigfoot 
                began to spread. Add-on advancement of technology and usage of online databases tracking the humungous primate became more efficient. 
                Thereby causing a stark increase in reported sightings in the late 1990s, continuing the trend until 2012. Since, mass popularity and the search 
                of Bigfoot as almost disappeared, leaving the once famous hairy giant as an old memory. 
                </p>
            <h2>Why the Lack of sightings?</h2>
                <p>
                As aforementioned the popularity of Bigfoot has drastically decreased. However, there are still many people who continue to search today. 
                We theorize other reasons sightings have decreased are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Is Bigfoot evolving?</em></li>
                        <p>Possibly, the increased hunting is causing Bigboot to adapt to the changes in his surroundings. Being more stealthy or well hidden.</p>
                    <li><em>Is Bigfoot dying out?</em></li>
                        <p>Potentially, the increased hunting is harming Bigfoot's ability to obtain food and shelter.</p>
                    <li><em>End of the Fad/Hoax?</em></li>
                        <p>The biggest conclusion which has been a part of Bigfoot conversations since the beginning, is the idea that it is all children's story
                        passed from parent to child.</p>
