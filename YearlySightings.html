                Bigfoot sightings were few and far between early on. It likely wasn't until the rise of the internet and social media that word of Bigfoot 
                really began to spread. With the advent of more advanced technology and the usage of online databases, tracking the humungous primate became more efficient, 
                thereby causing a stark increase in reported sightings in the late 1990s. This trend would continue until 2012. Since then, the popularity of the search 
                for Bigfoot has almost disappeared, leaving the once-famous hairy giant an old memory.

            <h2>Why the Lack of sightings?</h2>
                <p>
                As mentioned previously, the popularity of Bigfoot has drastically decreased. However, there are still many people who continue to search today. 
                We theorize other reasons sightings have decreased are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="listitem">Is Bigfoot evolving?</li>
                        <p>Possibly, the increased hunting is causing Bigfoot to adapt to the changes in his surroundings, becoming more stealthy or well-hidden.</p>
                    <li class="listitem">Is Bigfoot dying out?</li>
                        <p>Potentially, the increased hunting is harming Bigfoot's ability to obtain food and shelter.</p>
                    <li class="listitem">End of the Fad/Hoax?</li>
                        <p>The most likely conclusion which has been a part of Bigfoot conversations since the beginning, is the idea that it is all just a story
                        passed down from parents to their children.</p>
